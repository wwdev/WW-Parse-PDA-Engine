WW-Parse-PDA-Engine

This package implements the runtime for a Push-Down-Automaton (PDA) parser.
The parser engine (WW::Parse::PDA::Engine) uses tables to describe the
PDA that parses a particular grammar.

See WW-ParserGen-PDA for the parser-gen-pda.pl script that builds the tables
used by WW::Parse::PDA::Engine. See WW::Parse::PDA::ParserBase for subclassing
to easily build a parser front end that uses WW::Parse::PDA::Engine.
